description: "An introduction to myself and the purpose of this blog"
---
I am a software developer who lives in Columbus. I currently work in the health care industry writing software with which pharmacy systems integrate.

My journey into software began in university where I studied mechatronic engineering. My studies focussed primarily on the integration of electrical, mechanical and software systems, both conceptually and practically. The software component was particularly in regards to microcontrollers and low level systems. I became a barista after having moved to the US from Australia and struggling to find a job in mechatronics. It was there that I met numerous software developers from the company I currently work at, CoverMyMeds (CMM). They pointed me towards numerous resources and groups for learning web development and after a year of study I was able to land a position at CMM as an apprentice. I received a lot of help from many people in studying for this position and I try my best to help others who are in similar positions.

To that end, I hope that these blog posts help others who are curious about software. This blog will also serve as a way of recording lessons I have learned and my journey as a developer. The scope of each post will vary in specificity but I hope that they can be useful to others. The main tecnologies I use in my daily work are Ruby (and Rails), Python, and JavaScript, so these will be the primary languages used in these posts.

Enjoy!
