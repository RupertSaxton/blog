# Blog

This is a blog to detail thoughts I have had and lessons I have learned, or am in the process of learning. Also a good opportunity for me to learn the process behind hosting a website and practicing communicating my thoughts clearly and concisely. I used the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) as my template to get past tinkering with boilerplate and will slowly customise over time.

1.  **Developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
